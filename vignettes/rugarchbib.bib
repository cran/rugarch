  abstract = {This paper proposes a new intraday volatility forecasting model, particularly
	suitable for modeling a large number of assets. We decompose volatility
	of high-frequency returns into components that may be easily interpreted
	and estimated. The conditional variance is a product of daily, diurnal,
	and stochastic intraday components. This model is applied to a comprehensive
	sample consisting of 10-minute returns on more than 2500 US equities.
	Apart from building a new model, we obtain several interesting forecasting
	results. We apply a number of different specifications. We estimate
	models for separate companies, pool data into industries, and consider
	other criteria for grouping returns. In general, forecasts from pooled
	cross-section of companies outperform the corresponding forecasts
	from company-by-company estimation. For less liquid stocks, however,
	we obtain better forecasts when we group less frequently traded companies
	together.},
