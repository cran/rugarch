  Abstract                 = {This paper proposes a new intraday volatility forecasting model, particularly suitable for modeling a large number of assets. We decompose volatility of high-frequency returns into components that may be easily interpreted and estimated. The conditional variance is a product of daily, diurnal, and stochastic intraday components. This model is applied to a comprehensive sample consisting of 10-minute returns on more than 2500 US equities. Apart from building a new model, we obtain several interesting forecasting results. We apply a number of different specifications. We estimate models for separate companies, pool data into industries, and consider other criteria for grouping returns. In general, forecasts from pooled cross-section of companies outperform the corresponding forecasts from company-by-company estimation. For less liquid stocks, however, we obtain better forecasts when we group less frequently traded companies together.},
